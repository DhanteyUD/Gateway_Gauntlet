## 🎯 The Problem

Building on Solana requires deep understanding of transaction delivery strategies, but developers face significant challenges:

- **Complex Learning Curve** - Transaction optimization concepts are difficult to grasp from documentation alone
- **Expensive Experimentation** - Testing strategies with real transactions incurs costs and risks
- **Dynamic Network Conditions** - Constantly changing congestion requires adaptive approaches
- **Feature Discovery** - Advanced Gateway features like Jito+RPC fallback aren't immediately intuitive

**Gateway Gauntlet** provides a risk-free, engaging environment where you can master Solana transaction optimization without spending SOL or dealing with failed transactions.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### 1. **Choose Your Strategy**

Each strategy has unique characteristics suited for different scenarios:

| Strategy | Icon | Use Case | Cost | Speed | Reliability |
|----------|:----:|----------|:----:|:-----:|:-----------:|
| **Safe** | 🛡️ | Mission-critical transactions | Medium | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Balanced** | ⚖️ | General-purpose usage | Medium | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Fast** | ⚡ | Time-sensitive operations | **High** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Cheap** | 💰 | Cost-sensitive, non-urgent | **Very Low** | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### 2. **Monitor Network Conditions**

Network congestion directly impacts transaction success:

- 🟢 **Low Congestion** - All strategies work well
- 🟡 **Medium Congestion** - Strategy choice begins to matter
- 🟠 **High Congestion** - Requires optimization knowledge
- 🔴 **Extreme Congestion** - Only smart strategies succeed

### 3. **Send Transactions & Learn**

- Select a strategy based on current network conditions
- Observe transaction outcomes in real-time
- Analyze cost, latency, and success metrics
- Build intuition through the live transaction feed

### 4. **Optimize Your Score**

Points are awarded based on multiple factors:

- **Success Bonus** - `+100` points per confirmed transaction
- **Cost Efficiency** - Bonus points for cheaper successful transactions
- **Speed Performance** - Rewards for low-latency delivery
- **Level Multiplier** - Your score potential increases with experience
- **Failure Penalty** - `-5` points (small penalty encourages learning)

**Pro Tip**: The highest scores come from matching the right strategy to network conditions!
